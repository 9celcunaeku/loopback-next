If you want to play Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars on your PC, you will need a copy of the game and a crack fix from PROPHET, a group of hackers that release cracked versions of games. A crack fix is a file that modifies the game's executable to bypass the copy protection and allow you to play without a CD or DVD. Here are the steps to install and play Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars with CrackFix-PROPHET:
 
1. Download Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars MULTi11 from any torrent site or file-sharing platform. Make sure it is the version from PROPHET, which includes 11 languages and all updates and DLCs.
2. Extract the downloaded file using WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get an ISO file, which is a virtual image of a CD or DVD.
3. Mount the ISO file using Daemon Tools or any other virtual drive software. This will create a virtual CD or DVD drive on your PC that contains the game files.
4. Run the setup.exe file from the virtual drive and follow the instructions to install the game. You can choose any language and destination folder you want.
5. When the installation is complete, do not run the game yet. Go back to the virtual drive and open the PROPHET folder. You will find a file called ppt-cnc3.exe, which is the crack fix.

If you want to master Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars, you will need more than just a crack fix. You will also need some tips and tricks to improve your skills and strategies in this challenging game. Here are some of the best tips and tricks for Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars:

- Know your faction. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique units, structures, abilities, and upgrades. Learn the pros and cons of each faction and how to use them effectively. For example, GDI has powerful tanks and aircraft, but they are expensive and slow to build. Nod has stealthy and fast units, but they are fragile and vulnerable to detection. Scrin has alien technology and devastating superweapons, but they are dependent on Tiberium and weak against anti-air defenses.
- Harvest Tiberium efficiently. Tiberium is the lifeblood of your economy and your army. You need to harvest it as fast and as safely as possible. Build multiple harvesters and refineries to increase your income. Protect your harvesters from enemy attacks with escorts or defenses. Expand your base to new Tiberium fields when your original ones are depleted. Use silos to store excess Tiberium when you have more than you can spend.
- Scout the map. Information is power in Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars. You need to know what your enemy is doing, where they are, and what they have. Use scout units, such as bikes, buggies, or seekers, to explore the map and reveal the fog of war. Use radar scans, spy planes, or probes to monitor enemy movements and activities. Use spies, saboteurs, or assimilators to infiltrate enemy buildings and steal their technology or secrets.
- Build a balanced army. Don't rely on a single type of unit or strategy in Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars. You need to have a diverse and adaptable army that can counter any threat and exploit any weakness. Mix infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and support units to create a versatile force. Use combined arms tactics to maximize your firepower and minimize your losses. For example, use infantry to capture buildings or garrison structures, use vehicles to crush infantry or destroy buildings, use aircraft to harass enemy harvesters or bomb enemy defenses, use support units to heal or repair your units or disrupt or disable enemy units.
- Use superweapons wisely. Superweapons are the ultimate weapons in Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars. They can inflict massive damage or devastation on your enemy's base or army. However, they are also expensive, time-consuming, and risky to use. You need to use them wisely and strategically. Don't waste them on minor targets or empty areas. Save them for critical moments or decisive strikes. Protect them from enemy sabotage or counterattacks. Coordinate them with your allies or other attacks for maximum effect.

These are just some of the basic tips and tricks for Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars. There are many more advanced strategies and tactics that you can learn from playing the game or watching other players online. The best way to improve your skills is to practice, experiment, and have fun!
