The film's setting, a suburban house in Paris on Christmas Eve, is also significant. The house is a symbol of Sarah's loneliness and vulnerability, as well as her attachment to her past and her husband. The house is also contrasted with the outside world, which is chaotic and violent. The film takes place during the 2005 riots in France, which were sparked by the death of two immigrant teenagers who were chased by the police. The film shows glimpses of the riots on TV and through the windows, as well as the presence of police officers who are either incompetent or corrupt. The film also implies that the woman is an immigrant herself, who faces discrimination and hostility from the French society.
